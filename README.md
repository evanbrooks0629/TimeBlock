A web app used to timeblock your day by letting users visually see the duration of events.

## Getting Started
To begin using TimeBlock, first start by navigating to the homepage: https://evanbrooks0629.github.io/TimeBlock/.
Once you've arrived, simply click the "Get Started" button to go to your dashboard (or visit this link: https://evanbrooks0629.github.io/TimeBlock/dashboard).

## Your Dashboard

Here, you are shown a calendar-like view of the current day. To navigate up to a week back, simply click the back arrow at the top. To navigate up to a week forward, simply click the next arrow at the top.

Considering that there is access to a week back, a week in the future, and the current day, you have access to a total of 15 days of timeblocking.
Also, the left side of your current day shows hatch marks corresponding to 15 minute intervals from 6am to 12am. The hour-marks are labelled as such. The green chunk shows the current hour of the day that it is.

In the middle of the arrows is the current day. You are automatically placed at the current day, which is the only day that says "(Today)" next to it.

At the far right of your dashboard is the "Home" button. This returns you to the TimeBlock homepage.

## Adding Blocks
To add a block to the current day, simply click the "Add Block" button.

A pop-up window will be displayed to allow you to input your event. You can customize the name, duration (in intervals of 15 minutes), and the color.

Once you click "Add Block", the new block will be displyed at the top of your day. To put it at a certain time, simply drag vertically.

For any event you have, including classes, meetings, work, gym, etc., you can create blocks. You can also enter a block with no name to still represent a chunk of time.
Here is an example of a full day using TimeBlock:

## Editing, Completing, and Deleting Blocks
To edit a block, just click the pencil icon on the block. A pop-up will be displayed that can be edited with your changes.

To delete the block, simply click the trash can icon. The deleted block will no longer show up on your day.

To set a block as completed, just check the box on the right right of the block.

When a block is completed, the name will be striked through and the box will be checked.

## Using TimeBlock
The best way to make the most of TimeBlock is by creating blocks in advance. For example, taking the 15 minutes the night before a long day can ensure you move through your day with ease. If events are different than you assumed, like if the duration lasts longer or shorter than usual, you can simply edit the block.
As you move through your day, make sure to check events off as you go. You should try to keep up with the green box on the left side.

It is important to know that TimeBlock makes use of local storage to store data. So, your TimeBlock on your computer is not the same as the one on your phone. The reason I did this is so the website can be displayed as an app on your phone.

## Getting TimeBlock On Your iPhone
To get it on your phone, start by navigating to the website on your mobile device. Then, on the bottom of your screen, click the "Share" button.

Then, click "Add to home screen". Once that popup occurs, you should see this:

Then, click "Add". This will display TimeBlock as an app on your phone with the logo. Now, you can use it just like any other calendar application.
